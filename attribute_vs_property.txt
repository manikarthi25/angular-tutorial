Attribute VS Property

1. Both are not same
2. Attribute is defined by HTML
3. Property is defined by DOM(Document Object Model)
4. Attributes initialize the DOM properties and they are done.
5. Attribute values can not change once they are initialized
6. Property values can be change

$0.getAttribute('value') -> Mani
$0.value -> Mani
After change value from Mani to Karthi
$0.getAttribute('value') -> Mani
$0.value -> Karthi
